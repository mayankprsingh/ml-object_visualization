# ml-object_visualization
It was an individual project which I did in my summer training. I
have used Python and concepts of Machine Learning on
CIFAR-10 Dataset to visualize objects. Platform I have used for
this project was Kaggle. The outcome was to label the test
dataset and compare the accuracy.
